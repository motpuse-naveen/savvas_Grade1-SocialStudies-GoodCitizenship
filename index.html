                    <p><i><span class="bold">How to Be a Good Citizen </span></i> is the anchor text for this set.
                        Depending on the needs of your class, you may choose to assign <i><span class="bold">How to Be a
                                Good Citizen</span></i> for independent reading, or you may choose to read it aloud with
                        the class. Beginning with the anchor text will ground students in concepts and academic
                        vocabulary that are key to discussing the Big Question. As students read the other texts in the
                        set, they will compare their new understandings, as well as the structure and features of the
                        text, with the anchor text.</p>

                        <i>What does it mean to be a good citizen?</i> Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What are some
                            things good citizens do? How can you be a good citizen at school?

                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words <i><span
                                class="bold">respect, kind, share,</span></i> and <i><span class="bold">rules.</span></i>
                        Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">Who is a
                            person you <span class="bold">respect</span>? A <span class="bold">kind</span> person helps
                            others. What is something you do when you are being <span class="bold">kind</span>? Why would a kind person <span class="bold">share</span>? A <span
                                class="bold">rule</span> tells what to do or what not to do. Can you give me an example

                        create their own chart in a notebook. Help kids write new words under “Write,” and draw and
                        define them based on details in the text. An entry for <span class="bold">kind</span> might look

                    <h3 class="normaltext mb2"><span class="bold uppercase">Big Question</span></h3>
                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: <i>What does it mean to be a good citizen?</i> Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">How do you think <i>Citizens in Our Community</i> will help you think about the Big Question? Who are some good citizens in your community?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words <span class="bold"> citizen, community, care,</span> and <span class="bold"> laws.</span> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Say:
                    <span class="blue_scripting">A <span class="bold">citizen</span> is a person who is part of a <span class="bold">community</span>. The community can be a neighborhood, a country, or another place. What is an example of a community? How can you be a good citizen in a community? How do <span class="bold">laws</span> or rules help people in a community? How do people <span class="bold">care</span> for us, or keep us healthy?</span></p>

                    <p> Much of the vocabulary in <i>Citizens in Our Community</i> should be familiar to most students, but other texts in this set include words that might be new or challenging. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">People have <span class="bold">responsibilities</span>, or things that they should do. What <span class="bold">responsibilities</span> does a firefighter have? What <span class="bold">responsibilities</span> does a doctor have?

                    <p>Share a three-column chart with columns labeled “Write,” “Draw,” and “Define.” Have students create their own chart on a piece of paper. Help kids write new words under “Write,” and draw and define them based on details in the text. An entry for <span class="bold">community</span> might look like this: </p>

                    <p>Share or review how to make a three-column chart with columns labeled “Write,” “Draw,” and “Define.” Have students create their own chart on a piece of paper. Guide them to identify new words from the text and add them under “Write.” Help them add words or phrases to define each term under “Define,” and ask them to draw a picture under “Draw.” An entry for <span class="bold">responsibility</span> might look like this:

                    <p>An important part of building a vibrant classroom culture is creating an atmosphere in which all
                        students feel empowered to participate in powerful classroom conversation. You may have noticed
                        that
                        your students who are naturally extroverted often participate freely in a whole-class
                        discussion,
                        while those who are more introverted or, perhaps, who come from cultures that respect different
                        classroom norms, may need encouragement to share. You can use sentence prompts like these to
                        invite
                        all students into the conversation:</p>
                    <p>“That’s so interesting … please tell me more!”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone explain that in a different way?”</p>
                    <p>“What are some examples of that?”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone add on to that idea?”</p>
                    <p>Sharing and discussing ideas will often involve agreeing and/or disagreeing with what others say.
                        As
                        students listen carefully and respond thoughtfully to their classmates’ ideas, encourage them to
                        express themselves in respectful and constructive ways. You may wish to post these sentence
                        starters
                        prominently, so students can refer to them often:</p>
                    <p>“I agree, and I also think <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I mostly agree, but <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I like what you just said because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
                    <p>“I respectfully disagree because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl">__________</span> .”</p>
